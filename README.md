# Antivirus Scanner

A web-based antivirus scanner application that scans directories for malware using a predefined list of MD5 hash signatures. Built with Python and Flask, the application allows users to input a directory path and checks for infected files by comparing their hashes against known malware signatures.

## Features

- **Efficient Malware Detection**: Quickly scans files in a directory for potential malware by comparing file hashes.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: User-friendly interface with options to input directory paths and view scan results.
- **Customizable UI**: Modern, responsive, and futuristic UI design that includes:
  - Background customization
  - Animated buttons
  - Error and success notifications
- **Secure and Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies and fast operations.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core application logic.
- **Flask**: Web framework to handle routes and templates.
- **HTML & CSS**: Frontend design with a responsive and futuristic layout.

## Installation
